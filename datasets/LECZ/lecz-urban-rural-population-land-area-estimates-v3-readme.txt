Urban-Rural Population and Land Area Estimates, v3 (1990, 2000, 2015)


PURPOSE

To provide estimates of urban and rural populations and land areas for the years 1990, 2000, 2015 for 234 countries and statistical areas with contiguous coastal elevations of less than or equal to 5m above sea level, 5-10m above sea level, and national totals using multiple updated data sources for comparative analysis.


ABSTRACT

The Low Elevation Coastal Zone (LECZ) Urban-Rural Population and Land Area Estimates, Version 3 data set includes estimates of land areas and total population (counts) within urban, quasi-urban, and rural, areas in 0-5m and 5-10m LECZs, and non-coastal areas at any elevation (outside of LECZs), for 234 countries and other recognized territories for the years 1990, 2000, and 2015. The data set also includes one spatial layer: LECZ delineations generated from the Multi-Error-Removed Improved-Terrain Digital Elevation Model (MERIT-DEM). The population and land area estimates table provides a range of estimates for population and land area based on four data sources for population counts, four alternative digital elevation models, and four sources of spatially-delimited urban classifications. This data set is produced by the Columbia University Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN) and the City University of New York (CUNY) Institute for Demographic Research (CIDR).

This data set updates initial estimates for the LECZ population and land area by drawing on a newer collection of input data, and provides a range of estimates for at-risk population and land area based on these various sources. Constructing accurate estimates requires high-quality and methodologically consistent input data, and LECZv3 evaluates multiple data sources for population totals, digital elevation model, and spatially-delimited urban classifications. The accompanying peer reviewed publication (https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-2021-165) describes detailed methodology and sensitivity analysis. The authors selected as their core data sets those LECZ estimates generated from the Multi-Error-Removed Improved-Terrain Digital Elevation Model (MERIT-DEM), Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL) Population Grid R2019 and Degree of Urbanization Settlement Model Grid R2019a v2, and the Gridded Population of the World, Version 4 (GPWv4), Revision 11 for a number of reasons discussed in the publication.
