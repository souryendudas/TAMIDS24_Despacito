# TAMIDS24_Despacito

This repository is a project for the TAMIDS 2024 Data Science competition during Spring 2024 at TAMU ([link](https://tamids.tamu.edu/student-data-science-competition/2024-data-challenge/)). The competition challenges student to perform a narrative-driven analysis to understand the impact of the sea level rise.

The repository is organized as follows:

- **code:** contains Python notebooks used in the analysis.
- **datasets:** gathers small and medium-size datasets used in the analysis. For large datasets, code or link is provided
- **figures:** contains figures in the website, midterm, and final reports.
